# Chess-Game
This chess game is a collaborative effort developed by three group members using Prolog, a logic programming language that effectively represents the game's design and underlying logic. The program begins by displaying the initial chessboard layout.
The game features two players: Player A, controlled by a human, and Player B, an AI-driven computer opponent. The game's logic is structured so that after Player A makes a move, Player B analyzes the board state and strategically determines its next move.
